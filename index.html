        <h4>UW HCDE, Winter 2023</h4>
        <p>
          This winter, I will be joining HCDE professor Dr. David W. McDonald, Microsoft's Dr. Colin
          Clement, and fellow HCDE students on the
          <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/research/mcdonald">Designing with Large Language

        </p>
        <p>
          Within this project, I am looking forward to deepening my understanding of IDEs and
          further developing my python proficiency and prototyping skills. This will be my first
          experience working with LLMs, and we will be working with them on OpenAI. I will post
          deliverables from my work and research in the coming months.

              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                The Game of Thrones Family Tree Generator is a website that I designed that accesses
                a public API to generate a random family tree of character from the renowned HBO
                series. The user can indicate specifics for the generation of their tree on the front
                page, such as the size of their family tree and their preferred gender for the main
                character.

            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            <p>
              The objective of this project was to implement fetch requests to a public API and
              subsequently handle the response from the request. This involved incorporating a
              status check function, converting the reponse to the appropriate type, integrating
              handler methods to express the API response in the desired fashion, and developing
              meaningful error handling.

            <article>
              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>
                For this project, I decided to take it in the direction of a family tree since I
                could use my knowledge of appending children to the DOM (Document Object Model) via
                the JavaScript as a way of build the family tree. The user's indication of a small
                or big family tree determined whether I was appending children to two or four
                different sections on the main DOM.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created two different arrays of numbers, one of numbers that matched female
                characters and another with numbers that matched male characters. Numbers were
                randomly selected from these arrays and passed in as GET request query parameters to
                return a JSON object of the character's information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the JSON object was returned, a character card HTML element was made that
                included the name and photo of the random male or female character using the
                information in the JSON object and then was appended to the appropriate section of
                the DOM (family tree level).
              </p>
            </article>
          </article>
          <article id="takeaways-ft">
            <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
            <p>
              From this project, I grasped the usage of .then/.catch chains for handling fetch
              requests to REST APIs. I also gained proficiency with integrating data from different
              parts of my code to generate fetch requests with specific query parameters as well as
              accessing and transforming data from the returned JSON object to create a nested HTML
              element to attach to the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving forward, things I would do to improve this project that I didn't get a chance
              to implement would be eliminating redundancy of generated characters generated so that
              an individuals could only appear once on the family tree. In review, this project
              allowed me to extensively experiment with handling APIs  and fetch requests and
              further master my ability to generate HTML elements and manipulate the DOM.

          <h4 id="hg-title">What is Husky Guide?</h4>
          <p>
            Husky Guide is a mobile device app mock-up developed by me and two other classmates in
            our Introduction to User-Centered Design class. The app was an interactive map of
            campus that contained information about different dining locations and provided users
            with directions to those locations.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <p>
            This project was completed in Fall 2021, which was the University of Washington's
            first quarter with in-person classes following the COVID shutdown. Upon their return
            to campus, students were faced with many new safety and health regulations to minimize
            the spread of COVID. Many of these regulations revolved around eating and dining on
            campus, and the challenge as to where to go to buy and eat food on campus arose.
            Students also had different on-campus dining needs, such as access to microwaves to
            warm up food brought from home. Display and communication of dining and masking
            regulations in different places was both minimal and confusing, thus creating the need
            for a single source of information for University of Washington students.
          </p>
          <h4>The Goal</h4>
          <p>
            Our goal was to enable students to locate establishments and services on campus that
            fulfill their dining needs in a straightforward fashion. This included directions to
            desired location from the user's current location, and detailed information about
            regulations and menus from on-campus dining options.

        <section class="alternating">
          <h4>Research</h4>
          <p>
            In the research stage, we conducted multiple steps to better understand the targeted
            users and their needs. We conducted interviews, developed user personas, and created a
            user journey map.

        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Design</h4>
          <p>In the design stage, we created storyboards and information architecture.</p>
          <article>
            <img src="mats/claires-storyboard.png" alt="storyboard created by Claire Surbeck for
            the Husky Guide project">
            <p>
              When creating storyboards, I created two versions: one with photos of a potential
              storyline that I developed and reenacted and another with illustrations.
              The information architecture outlined the four major functionalities of our app and
              offered visualization of the levels and variety of information stored within the
              different functionalities.

          <h4>Prototyping</h4>
          <p>
            Finally, in the prototyping stage, our development path started with lo-fi prototypes
            before moving onto the development of wireframes, and then hi-fi prototypes.

          I found a love for programming through HCDE, and took my first coding class last fall.
          Since then, I have pursued deeper knowledge and mastery of OOP languages, data structures,
          and algorithms in addition to my engineering courses, and recently completed a Web
          Programming class that enabled me to build this portfolio website from scratch! I am
          excited to move forward in the field of user-centered design with my passion for
          programming to work towards building user-friendly, intuitive interfaces that are both
          visually appealing and efficiently implemented. I have a lot more to learn, but I am
          enjoying every day of the process and figuring out how I can use my skills for good!

            Outside of rowing and school, I am an avid outdoorswoman and love to be in the kitchen
            and the garden. I especially love to nordic ski in the Methow Valley and backpack in the
            Cascades. The newest dessert I learned to make was tiramisu, as I was lucky enough to be
            mentored by my Italian roommate!
